Gather the required components: Raspberry Pi, Arduino Uno, GPS module (such as the Ublox NEO-6M), breadboard, jumper wires, USB cable for connecting the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi.

Connect the GPS module to the breadboard. Make sure to connect the VCC pin to the breadboard's positive power rail, and the GND pin to the negative power rail.

Connect the GPS module's TX pin to the Arduino's RX pin (pin 0) using a jumper wire. Connect the GPS module's RX pin to the Arduino's TX pin (pin 1) using another jumper wire.

Connect the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi using a USB cable.

Power up the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino by connecting them to a power source.

Open the Arduino IDE on your computer and upload the following sketch to the Arduino:

scss
Copy code
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // set the baud rate to 9600
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) { // if data is available to read
    char c = Serial.read(); // read it
    Serial.write(c); // write it back out so we can see it
  }
}
Open a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi and type the following command to verify that the Arduino is connected:
bash
Copy code
ls /dev/tty*
You should see a list of available serial ports. Look for one that starts with /dev/ttyACM. This is the serial port for the Arduino.

Install the gpsd software on the Raspberry Pi by typing the following command in the terminal:
csharp
Copy code
sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps
Type the following command to stop the gpsd service:
vbnet
Copy code
sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket
Type the following command to start the gpsd service:
bash
Copy code
sudo gpsd /dev/ttyACM0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
Replace /dev/ttyACM0 with the serial port for your Arduino.

Type the following command to verify that the GPS module is connected and sending data:
Copy code
cgps -s
You should see a stream of data showing the GPS coordinates and other information.

Congratulations, you have successfully connected the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and GPS module physically by wires.
